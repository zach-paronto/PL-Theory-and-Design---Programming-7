## Due Dates

Early turn-in: April 6, 11:59 PM
Hard turn-in: April 9, 11:59 PM

## Assignments

The programming assignment consists of 2 parts:

- Warmup: a simple introduction to Rust as a language. This is ungraded.
- 1: you will build a calculator in Rust, similar to the Haskell assignment in PA6.


Each section has a README.md associated with it. Read those before getting started.
The `rust-warmup` is optional/not-graded but highly recommended to get started.
It only takes 5 minutes.

Additionally, the exercises in the `rust-1` folder are optional, but recommended.


## Grading

We have included the points-worth of each question in the comments. As before, you'll
be able to submit to Gradescope to see your current scoring.

Note: Grading rust is hard! If your code does not compile, I cannot give you any points.
You'll want to implement all functions before submitting to ensure that there are no issues,
or implement at least a stub of the function so that the compile won't complain.

## Submission

You must submit the assignment via gradescope. Submit your assignment by uploading the following files only:

- parser.rs
- rpn.rs

Unlike the first assignment, the autograder will not look for your files or
otherwise fix your bugs. You may only upload these files and you must ensure
they can be loaded.
